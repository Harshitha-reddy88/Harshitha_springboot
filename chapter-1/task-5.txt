Q) Reflect on Dependencies: Think about all the services and tools youâ€™d rely on 
during your Swiss journey,from travel agencies to GPS apps. How do these 
dependencies relate to the Dependency Inversion Principle in software design?

In my Swiss traveling my highlevel dependencies will be my whole checklist
and my plan for the trip and my low level dependencies will be my traveling thisgs 
and the abstraction will be the traveling services 

as my plane is highlevel module and traveling vechicles are low level module they 
both are dependent on eachother and they both are dependent on the abstraction 
on traveling services here agencies and GPS apps will be my low level modules which are
dependent on my highlevel module of my checklist
