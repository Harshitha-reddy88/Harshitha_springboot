Q) Travel Constraints: Consider restrictions or rules you might encounter on your
 journey, like luggage weight limits or visa requirements. How would these 
 constraints translate to software design principles?

 ** Single Responsibility Principle: we are traveling from one county to other country 
 we will have the restrictions fro our visa requairements and our laguage weight limits
 In this case our visa requairements will may differe from country to another country
 but it has a single responsibility of holding out personal details and eventhough 
 we have the restriction of laguage limitation it has a single responsibility if holding
 our belongings

 ** Open/Closed Principle: As we have different requairements of visa it is opened 
 to add our own details that nedded to it's verification purposebut it is closed to
 enter others details in our visa verification

 ** Dependency Inversion Principle: when we are traveling from one place to another
 place we will have some important thigs to take with us even we have the wieght 
 limitation of laguage. Here the things that are important for us is low level module
 and the wieght limitation is hight level module.so taht we will prioritise our important
 belongings according to the wieght limitations where the rule of wieght limitation
 will not depend on our important things
