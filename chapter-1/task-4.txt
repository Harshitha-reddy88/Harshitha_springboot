Q) Customized Itinerary: Design a travel itinerary for a friend who has different preferences
 than you. How would you ensure that your base plan (OOP) can be adapted to fit 
 their needs (Design Principles)?

my list for the travel (base list/super list):
1) party wears
2) normal wears
3) medicals
4) passport
5) extra accessories
6) powerbank
7) room (2 star hotel)

my friend travel list:
he need all those things which are there in my travel list exept normal wears and 
power bank, and he has some preferences to add (laptop,mobile charger,suumer weras etc..)
to that list and make his own list

the final list for my friend which is inheritaed from my list(sublist):
1) party wears
2) medicals
3) passport
4) extra accessories
5) mobile charger
6) laptop
7) summer wears
8) photo album
9) camera
10)playing things
11) room (5 star hotel)

In the above scenario my friend travel list is inherited from my travel list by 
removing some needs and adding his preferences .

encapsulation : As my friend have different preferences I can secure my traveling 
and meals details
abstraction : Even my friend is traveling trought the same country that I have already
visited he no need to know how I reached there and how much money that I spend on each
and every thing.
polymarphism : even my friend and me are visiting same place where we have to use
the same currancy his preferences is totally different from my preferences
